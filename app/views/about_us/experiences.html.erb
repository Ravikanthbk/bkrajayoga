						The most important journey you can take is the journey within. This is a journey to the truth of who you really are. This is the place, just beyond everyday consciousness, where real empowerment begins. Inner power gives you the strength to choose creative thinking rather than automated thinking, response rather than reaction, peace, love and harmony rather than stress, conflict and chaos.
						</p>
						<p>  
						Meditation enables you to embark on this inward journey. Brahma Kumaris Raja Yoga meditation gives you a clear understanding of your inner self, helps you rediscover and use the positive qualities already latent within you.
