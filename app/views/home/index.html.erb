  <p class="open-eye-meditation">Ever meditated with your eyes open?</p>
  <p class="raja-yoga-p"><span class="raja-yoga-span">Raja Yoga</span> is a unique method of meditation that you can do anywhere – especially when you most need to be at peace. Learn to be an oasis of calm & stability in the midst of chaos and uncertainty. It is easier than you think…it is about returning to your natural state of self awareness, your natural state of being positive.
